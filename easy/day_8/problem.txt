Imagine you're playing a cool game called Cubecraft. You start with just one stick, but you're eager to make a bunch of torches. Each torch needs one stick and one coal.

Now, you meet a friendly trader with two offers:

Trade one stick for x sticks. (You give one stick and get x sticks.)
Trade y sticks for one coal. (You give y sticks and get one coal.)

Your goal is simple: figure out the fewest trades needed to make at least k torches. You can use each offer as many times as you want, in any order.

You'll need to find this answer for multiple rounds of the game. But don't worry, there's always a way to do it within the rules of the game!

You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n. The length of the i-th stick is 2^(a[i]). You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater than 0. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks does not matter (for example, choosing the 1-st, 2-nd and 4-th stick is the same as choosing the 2-nd, 4-th and 1-st stick).

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1<= t <= 10000)  — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
the first line contains one integer n (1≤n≤300000);
the second line contains n integers a[1], a[2], … , a[n] (0 <= a[i] <= n)
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 300000.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Consider a positive integer to be extremely round if it consists of only one non-zero digit. For instance, numbers like 5000, 4, 1, 10, and 200 qualify as extremely round, while numbers like 42, 13, 666, 77, and 101 do not.

You're provided with an integer, n. Your task is to determine the count of extremely round integers, denoted as x, where 1≤x≤n.

Input
Begin by inputting an integer, t (1≤t≤10^4), indicating the number of test cases.

Following this, t lines ensue. Each line contains an integer, n (1≤n≤999999), describing the respective test case.

Output
For each test case, produce a single integer—the count of extremely round integers, x, satisfying the condition 1≤x≤n.

Constraints
Constraints to consider are as follows:

1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ n ≤ 999999

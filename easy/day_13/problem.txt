Bluemin, a young enthusiast for challenges, faces a mind-boggling problem posed by Minaal to put his ambition to the test.

The task at hand is to manipulate an array of integers [A1, A2, A3,..., AN] in such a way that the product of all its elements equals zero. Bluemin can perform a single operation on any chosen element, adjusting its value by either incrementing or decrementing it. He is free to repeat this operation on different elements as needed.

The puzzle begins with Bluemin receiving two lines of input:

The first line holds a single integer, N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), indicating the size of the array.
The second line consists of N integers, A1, A2, A3,..., AN, with each Ai satisfying the constraint -10^5 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5.
To conquer this challenge, Bluemin must determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired product of zero.

Bluemin, with his determination and analytical skills, is ready to tackle this problem head-on. Let's see how he overcomes it!

You have a bunch of numbers, and for each number, you can remove digits one at a time. 
But you can't leave just one digit remaining. 
Your goal is to find the minimum number of digit removals needed to make the resulting number divisible by 25 and positive. 
Remember, the resulting number shouldn't have any leading zeroes.

You're given a set of test cases, each with a different number. 
For each test case, you need to figure out how many digits you should remove to achieve a number divisible by 25.

Input:
You'll receive several test cases. Each test case contains a positive integer.

Output:
For each test case, output the minimum number of digit removals required to obtain a positive number divisible by 25.

Remember, the numbers given won't have any leading zeroes.

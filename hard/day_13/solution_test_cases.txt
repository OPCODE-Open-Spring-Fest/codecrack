Note:
Let's consider the first test sample. Let's assume that Bluemin initially had sequence (red; blue; red), so there are six ways to pick a zebroid:

    pick the first marble;
    pick the second marble;
    pick the third marble;
    pick the first and second marbles;
    pick the second and third marbles;
    pick the first, second and third marbles. 

It can be proven that if Bluemin picks (blue; red; blue) as the initial sequence, the number of ways won't change.

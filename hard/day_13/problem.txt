Bluemin is engaged in a game with red and blue marbles. He has arranged n marbles in a row from left to right. 
Surprisingly, the arrangement forms a zebroid.

A zebroid is a non-empty sequence of red and blue marbles where the colors alternate. 
For instance, sequences like (red; blue; red) and (blue) are zebroids, while (red; red) is not.

Now Bluemin ponders over the number of ways to select a zebroid subsequence from this arrangement. 
He seeks your assistance in solving this intriguing puzzle and finding the count modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Input

The first line presents a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), indicating the count of marbles in Bluemin's sequence.

Output

Your task is to print a single number, the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

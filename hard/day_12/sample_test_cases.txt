Consider the queries of the example test.

-> in the first query, the substring is baa, which can be changed to bac in one operation;
-> in the second query, the substring is baacb, which can be changed to cbacb in two operations;
-> in the third query, the substring is cb, which can be left unchanged;
-> in the fourth query, the substring is aa, which can be changed to ba in one operation.

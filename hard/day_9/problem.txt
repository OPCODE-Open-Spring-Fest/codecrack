Before the commencement of the football season in Bhagalpur, a peculiar magical ritual takes place. 
The seasoned sorcerers must uncover a mystical grid of dimensions n × n (where n is an even number). The deities forbid the commencement of the championship without it. 
This matrix must comprise integers ranging from 0 to n - 1, with the main diagonal exclusively containing zeroes, and the matrix being symmetrical. 
Furthermore, each row must consist of distinct numbers. The sorcerers, weary from their mental exertions, beseech you to devise a program to unearth such a matrix.

Input:
The initial line presents a single integer, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), where n is an even number.

Output:
Dispense n lines, each comprising n numbers — the sought-after matrix. Separate the numbers with spaces. If multiple solutions exist, output any one of them.

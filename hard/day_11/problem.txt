Imagine a festive gathering where people engage in round dances. Each dance circle must consist of at least 2 individuals, and every person must have exactly two neighbors. In a circle of 2 people, each person shares the same neighbor on both sides.

Your task is to determine the minimum and maximum number of round dances possible given the information about the participants' remembered neighbors.

For instance, if there were 6 attendees at the festival, and their remembered neighbor numbers are [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5], then the minimum number of round dances would be 1, as illustrated by the sequence: 1−2−3−4−5−6−1. The maximum number would be 3, represented by: 1−2−13−4−35−6−5.

Input
Begin with a positive integer, t (1≤t≤10^4), indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case:
- The first line comprises a positive integer, n (2≤n≤2⋅10^5), denoting the number of people at the festival.
- The second line consists of n integers, ai (1≤ai≤n,ai≠i), representing the remembered neighbor numbers for each person.

Assumptions:
- The provided test cases are accurate and correspond to at least one valid division of people into round dances.
- The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output
For each test case, provide two integers—the minimum and maximum number of round dances achievable.

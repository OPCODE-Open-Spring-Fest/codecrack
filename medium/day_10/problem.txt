Bluemin, a young enthusiast, is fond of a particular operation. He has an array 'a' with 'n' elements and he's keen on performing the following operation repeatedly:

He selects two adjacent elements, removes them, and replaces them with a single integer, which is the result of their bitwise XOR. Note that this reduces the length of the array by one.

Bluemin wonders if he can transform all elements of the array to be equal. However, to keep things interesting, he insists on leaving at least 2 elements in the array.

Input:
The first line contains an integer 't' (1 ≤ t ≤ 15), indicating the number of test cases to solve.

For each test case:
- The first line contains an integer 'n' (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the number of elements in the array 'a'.
- The second line contains 'n' space-separated integers 'a1, a2, ..., an' (0 ≤ ai < 2^30), representing the elements of the array 'a'.

Output:
If Bluemin can make all elements equal while ensuring at least 2 elements remain, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

Imagine a string that stretches to infinity, composed of all positive integers in ascending order:

12345678910111213141516171819202122232425...

Your mission is to handle q inquiries of the following nature: what digit occupies position k in this string?

Input
Commence by inputting an integer q, indicating the number of inquiries.
Following this, there are q lines detailing the inquiries. Each line contains an integer k, representing a 1-indexed position in the string.

Output
For each inquiry, disclose the digit situated at the specified position.

Constraints

There are limitations to consider:

1 ≤ q ≤ 1000
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18

You are given an array a1,a2,…an. Count the number of pairs of indices 1≤i,j≤n such that ai<i<aj<j.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤10^9) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of pairs of indices satisfying the condition in the statement.
